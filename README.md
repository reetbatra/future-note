# FutureMe

FutureMe is a project inspired by the concept of writing letters to our future selves. It allows users to compose messages to be delivered to themselves at a chosen date in the future. 

## Features

- **Letter Composition**: Users can write letters to their future selves, expressing thoughts, goals, memories, or anything they desire.
- **Delivery Date Selection**: Users can choose the date on which they want their letter to be delivered, ranging from 6 months to 10 years into the future.
- **Confirmation Email**: Users receive a confirmation email to ensure the accuracy of their email address and delivery preferences.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Built with React and Vite and Tailwind CSS for a fast and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Developed in Python, handling the logic for letter composition, delivery scheduling, and user authentication.
